Final alkitab app using React Native Framework for my Research Project (SKRIPSI)

ABSTRACT
The diversity of regional languages is one of the characteristics of Indonesia. However, although it has hundreds of regional languages, it turns out that there are some of them that are in critical condition or critically endangered, one of the languages that are threatened with extinction is Talaud. This is what encourages researchers to develop Talaud-language Bible applications that can be run on Android smartphones so that they can be used anytime and anywhere. The purpose of this research is to produce a complete electronic Bible application in Talaud so that it can contribute to efforts to preserve the Talaud regional language.
In making this application the researcher uses the Spiral method because in the spiral method the development is not only done one way, but the existing stages can be re-done if there are still errors. The technology used is the Javascript programming language with the React Native framework and SQLite as the database used. The result of this research is the Old Testament New Testament Talaud Bible application, which has verse annotation features, verse bookmarks and verse share.
